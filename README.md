## Machine Learning week1

* Introduction
* Model and Cost Function
* Parameter Learning
* Linear Algebra Review

### Abstract

#### Supervised
* regression
* classification

#### Unsupervised
* clustering
* unclustetring

~~~
Traning set (x, y) -> learning algorithm  —> h() hypothesis
~~~

#### Linear Regression

* supervisor and regression
* one input value and output value
* cost functions is difference between thruth value and predicted value

1.  To find line that appropriate to data
2. Measure theta by using cost function
