# Introduction

## 1. What is Machine learning?

* The field of study that gives computers the ability to learn
Without being explicitly programmed(Arthur Samuel, this is older)

* A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

Example: playing checkers.

E = the experience of playing many games of checkers

T = the task of playing checkers.

P = the probability that the program will win the next game.


### Machine learning algorithms

* Supervised learning
* Unsupervised learning

#### Others 
* Reinforcement learning
* recommender systems

## 2. Supervised Learning

* Data set are given to our and we already know what our correct output should look like, having the idea that there is relationship between the input and the output

* categorized into regression and classification problems

* given right answer

### regressin -> output is continuous 

* Continuous valued output

* predict results within a continuous output -> mapping input variables to some continuous function

### classification -> output is discrete

* Discrete valued output

* predict results in a discrete output. -> mapping input variables into discrete categories


## 3. Unsupervised Learning

* given little or no idea what our results should look like.-> don't know what is correct

*  We can derive structure from data where we don't necessarily know the effect of the variables.

* Derive this structure by clustering the data based on relationships among the variables in the data

* No feedback based on the prediction results

* clustering and non-clustering
